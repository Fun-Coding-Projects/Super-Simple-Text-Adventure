You walk deeper and deeper into the Dark forest and you have an intense feeling
of foreboding.  Eventually you come to a neglected campsite.  There is a stove 
and several bags filled with food.

Would you like to ...

1) Run back and take the fork to the meadow?
2) Sit down and lite the stove and have lunch?
